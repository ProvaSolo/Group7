# NXP S32K358 SoC Documentation

## Overview

## Purpose of the SoC Files (`nxps32k358_soc.h` / `nxps32k358_soc.c`)

The purpose of the SoC files is to define and implement the **NXP S32K358 System on Chip (SoC) model** for QEMU. These files describe the overall microcontroller, integrating the ARM Cortex-M7 CPU, memory regions (Flash, SRAM, TCM), and all on-chip peripherals (such as LPUARTs and LPSPIs) into a single, unified device.

This SoC model serves several key purposes:

-   Provide a complete hardware model of the S32K358 microcontroller, allowing QEMU to emulate the real chip's behavior.
-   Aggregate and connect all internal components (CPU, memory, peripherals) so that software running in QEMU interacts with them as it would on real hardware.
-   Set up the memory map, clock tree, and interrupt routing for the entire chip.
-   Serve as the foundation for board-level emulation, enabling the simulation of real-world embedded systems using the S32K358.
-   Allow QEMU to recognize, instantiate, and manage the SoC as a device, making it possible to run and debug firmware or operating systems designed for the S32K358 microcontroller.

### Key Functions

#### `create_unimplemented_devices()`

-   **Purpose**: Creates unimplemented devices for a large set of peripherals that are present in the actual hardware but not yet implemented in QEMU. This ensures that accesses to these regions do not cause bus errors and can be logged for debugging. It maps the memory regions of these peripherals to a "unimplemented" device, allowing the system to continue functioning without crashing.

-   **Functionality**:

    -   Calls `create_unimplemented_device()` for each peripheral, specifying:
        -   A name string (for identification in logs).
        -   The base address of the peripheral.
        -   The size of the memory region (typically 0x4000, 16KB, but some are 64KB).

-   **Note**: The function covers a wide range of peripherals including timers, analog to digital converters, communication devices, DMA, memory/bus, security (erm0, erm1,fccu_m, mc_rgm, stcu, selftest_gpr), and other type of devices.

#### `nxps32k358_soc_initfn()`

-   **Purpose**: Initializes the SoC device and its child objects during instance creation.

-   **Functionality**:
    -   Initializes the ARMv7-M object (`armv7m`).
    -   Initializes the system configuration controller (`syscfg`).
    -   Initializes the input clocks:

    -   Initializes the LPUART and LPSPI child objects in arrays.

#### `nxps32k358_soc_realize()`

-   **Purpose**: Realizes the SoC device, including setting up memory regions, clocks, and realizing child devices. This function is called when the device is instantiated and performs the main setup, after the initialization the purpose of the realization is to connect all components together and prepare the SoC in the QEMU environment so that it can be used for emulation.

-   **Functionality**:
    -   **Clock Setup**:
        -   Checks that `sysclk` is connected (by board code) and `refclk` is not externally connected.
        -   Sets the `refclk` to run at `sysclk` frequency divided by 8.
        -   Sets the frequencies for `aips_plat_clk` (80 MHz) and `aips_slow_clk` (40 MHz). Clocks for Advanced IP bus Pheripheral Subsystems, bus used in NXP microcontrollers.

        -   Connects the SYSCFG's clock input to the main system clock (`sysclk`).
        -   Realizes (initializes and activates) the SYSCFG device so it becomes part of the emulated hardware.
        -   Maps the SYSCFG's memory-mapped I/O region to address `0x40013800` in the system's memory space.
